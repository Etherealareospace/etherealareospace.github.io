<p>This is the temporary changelog. Ethereal aerospace now has a budget of $2000, and it is going to build it's first rocket soon.... But! But first the owner of the company (me) will buy airsoft guns and host a battle. WHEE YAY look at me buying random things online </p>
<p> more info about the rocket: In true kerbal style, it runs off of a SRB. The frame is made of PLA plastic ( I know, what a disaster) and metal struts. The inside of it is coated in insulation and aluminum, and will be filled with dextrose ( BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD.... Nevermind, it's going to use something else. ) It will hold a dummy capsule that DOES NOTHING (except seperate, which will be done by a small gunpowder charge. Later plans inclue: Eleectronics, oxygen/hydrogen production machine thingy, dummy probes, actual probes, antennae, orbital capsules, etc etc.</p>
